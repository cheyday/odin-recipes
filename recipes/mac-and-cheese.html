            <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat oven to 175 degrees C.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; drain well.</li>
            <li>Melt 1/4 cup butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Stir in flour and salt; cook, stirring constantly, for 2 minutes. Whisk in milk and simmer, stirring frequently, until mixture thickens slightly, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Turn off the heat and stir in Cheddar cheese, in batches, until cheese is melted. Add macaroni and stir to coat.</li>
            <li>Pour into a 9x13-inch baking dish. Mix the remaining 1/4 cup of melted butter and crushed crackers together in a bowl; scatter evenly over macaroni mixture.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown on top, about 45 minutes.</li>
